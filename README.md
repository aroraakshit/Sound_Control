## Remembers
Build for specific output and input device.


## Holistics
* Save File.
* Optimise all sensors.

#### Microbit
* Get compass.

#### Colour Tracker
* Fix umenu that doesn’t work with more than 2 input devices.

#### Models

#### Sample Player


#### Granulator


#### Leap
* Make visualisation indicate Z position better.
* Implement leap finger angles.

## New Samples
* Make some ourselves on garage band.
** Deffo acoustic instruments (That’s all Jan knows).

    Orchestral pop covers.

    Group loops.

        Sax Groups.

Colour Detector

    Lets you set 3 colours to be tracked

    3 dimension input of just each colour is present to classifier.

Recorder

    Separate floating window which records the output of the instrument

    Could then be used with the volume object.

    Kid can listen back sounds they've made and compare.

    Self evaluation

    Mmmmm meta..

    Combine this with a mic recorder?

    Thought shower different interfaces for recording the instrument and recording the mic.

Internal Sound File Browser

    Save copies of SoundFiles in Library.

    Build internal menu to sounds in app.

    Integrate this into the instruments.

    How not to make internal sound finder polluted.

    Take into account more than one kid using the same app.

    Automatically name files and subdirectories.

    Divide stuff up with sample content.

Undo button for last recording sessions.

    Bring in notion of “classes” or number of recording sessions in the training data.

    Tell the user how many “classes” or number of recording sessions are in a file.

Piano sampler which you map areas of the piano to the sensor positions.

    Change Scale.

    Linear Regression.
