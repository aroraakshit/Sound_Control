Get Phoenix Perry to look at the app.


HOLISTIC
Undo button for last recording sessions.
	Bring in notion of “classes” or number of recording sessions in the training data.
	Tell the user how many “classes” or number of recording sessions are in a file.
Save file able to hold some meta data about the database that can be printed when loaded.
Poly buffer contents to the “generate” window.
	Thus making it static for the instrument. 
	This will stop the user from making a mapping for some files
		… then changing the files and having a mapping for
		… the old files still going.

UI
Stop window resizing.
Closing window instead of deleting subpatch OR
	Organise subpatch objects.

NEW INSTRUMENTS
Build a simple weird synth to play with.
Piano sampler which you map areas of the piano to the sensor positions
	Change Scale.
	Linear Regression.
Microphone input!!
	Wind instruments...
Multi Colour Tracker:
	Make it multi colours and then we can have an instrument which is a colour classifier.
Mixer-Looper
Change the looper to controlling gain instead on off.
	Then you can use regression to mix between them even if it’s just trained on.
